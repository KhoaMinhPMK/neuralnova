Payment brand assets

Replace the placeholder logos in this folder with the official brand assets you’re licensed to use. Keep file names the same so the UI updates automatically:

- alipay.svg
- bank.svg
- momo.svg
- payoneer.svg
- paypal.svg
- vnpay.svg
- zalopay.svg

Guidelines

- Prefer SVG for crisp rendering on all DPIs. If a brand only provides PNG, use PNG with transparent background and keep the same filename (.png extension is supported too).
- Safe size: height 18–20 px in UI, width auto. The CSS preserves aspect ratio (no stretching).
- Colors: do not alter brand colors. Provide original brand colors; the UI does not recolor icons.
- Clear space: many brands require minimum padding. Export logos with a small built‑in margin to avoid clipping on dark backgrounds.
- Dark background: our UI uses a dark background. If the original logo is also dark, provide the light variant from the brand kit.

How to update

1) Drop the official files into this folder with the exact names above.
2) Hard refresh your browser (Ctrl+F5). If hosted, redeploy and bust cache (e.g., append ?v=DATE to page URL).

Note

We cannot fetch or bundle official marks without permission. Please obtain them from each provider’s brand guidelines:
- MoMo, ZaloPay, VNPay, Alipay, PayPal, Payoneer, and your bank/PSP.
